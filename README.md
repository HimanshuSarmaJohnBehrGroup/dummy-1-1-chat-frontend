# One to One Video Calling Application using ReactJS and EnableX Toolkit for Web 

This is a sample one to one video calling client application in ReactJS that allows developers to implement video calling capabilities in their websites. The application runs on the web browsers (referred as client end point) and utilizes EnableX Web SDK to conduct an RTC session with its peers through EnableX Video Services. 

The client application performs the following tasks to facilitate an RTC session: 

* Get token from the application server 
* Connect to the room using the token 
* Publish audio/video streams in the room 
* Subscribe to remote audio/video streams in the room 
* Listen to any session related events

This sample client application also demonstrates the following features:

* Mute/Unmute video 
* Mute/Unmute audio 
* Session Recording 
* Chat 
* Screen share
